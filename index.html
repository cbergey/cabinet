      There Are Mornings by Lisel Mueller

      Even now, when the plot
      calls for me to turn to stone,
      the sun intervenes. Some mornings
      in summer I step outside
      and the sky opens
      and pours itself into me
      as if I were a saint
      about to die. But the plot
      calls for me to live,
      be ordinary, say nothing
      to anyone. Inside the house
      the mirrors burn when I pass.
